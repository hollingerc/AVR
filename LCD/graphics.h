 * Public interface for graphics.c.
 
 * This is a collection of simple line drawing functions for a monochrome
 * graphic display of up to 256 pixels wide by 256 pixels high.  The pixels are
 * normally addressed with the upper-left part of the display containing the
 * first pixel.
 *
 * It is assumed the display is byte addressable and each byte contains 8 pixels
 * arranged in a vertical line.  The LS Bit is the upper-most pixel of the line,
 * the MS Bit is the lower.  AS the bytes are sent to the display, they are
 * written from left to right.
 *
 * This type of display cannot be read, so any graphics displayed need to be
 * stored in a local data area in RAM.  The pointer graphics_frame points to
 * this area.  All these functions act on this chunk of RAM and not on the
 * display directly.  The RAM must be uploaded to the display for any changes
 * to take effect.  The upload function is not part of this software module, it
 * will be found in the module associated with the display.  Displays will have
 * different interfaces to the microcontroller: I2C, SPI, UART, parallel, etc.
 *

 * graphics_draw_line()

 * drawn and the algorithm presented only works with one.  Xiaolin Wu's line
 * algorithm, also from Wikipedia
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm,
 * manipulates the endpoints of the line in the beginning of the function to
 * account for these scenarios.
 *
 * The code here adapts both algorithms and simplifies Xiaolin Wu's by not
 * drawing the additional pixels drawn with intensities varying according to
 * their distance from the line.
 *
 * The origin of the Cartesian plane the line is drawn on is assumed to be in
 * the upper left corner.  The x coordinate increases to the right and the 
 * y coordinate increases downward.
